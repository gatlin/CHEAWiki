The following is an email I sent to a friend inquiring about starting a non-profit coop. It has links to useful resources and some decent advice.

Minor edits have been made so that the hyperlinks work.

First and foremost, to the NSA overlords reading this email, I hereby
disclaim that I am not an attorney and you should be very skeptical of
any advice that I give.

This email is strictly the non-profit advice so you can save it or
whatever. I'll converse in a different reply.

I'll answer thoroughly at the risk of insulting any knowledge you may
already have.

A non-profit corporation is a *state-level* entity. You fill out the
[relevant form on this page][1] and hand $25 to the county clerk's office.

The form also has all relevant details (and obviously trumps anything I
say). You'll want Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Here are CHEA's
bylaws as an example: http://chea.coop/Bylaws

(And here is the raw text of them so you can use ours as a base if you
like: http://chea.coop/_showraw/Bylaws)

To obtain 501(c)(3) tax exempt status you must do some additional
paperwork with the *federal* government. [Lots of good information here][2].

The short version: *after* forming your corporation at the state level,
you go to the IRS website, apply for an EIN (employer identification
number) and fill out Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ.

Now, here is something interesting: if your organization provides
low-income housing then you can virtually guarantee that your 501(c)(3)
application will be accepted by [following the advice here][3]. It's
called the Safe Harbor. If some percentage of your membership is below a
certain income level, congrats: you can be automatically tax exempt.

You mention in every single space on the form where you can write freely
that you qualify for Safe Harbor (maybe do it with some finesse but
really drill it in) and how you qualify and the bureaucrat processing
the form must grant your application.

Miscellaneous advice:

1. Apply as a non-profit, not a cooperative association. Yes, Texas does
have a special legal status for coops (and you do have to be one to
include "Coop" in your name) but Daniel Miller has advised me that if
you want to be damn certain the IRS knows what you're talking about, go
for non-profit.

2. Have a board of directors, don't be completely flat. Again, if your
goal is to maximize the chances the IRS will lay off you, you want to
show there's some structure.
