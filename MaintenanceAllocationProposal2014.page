We are considering the problem of allocating the annual amount of maintenance money sent back to CHEA by NASCO Properties from our lease payments to them.
Currently proposed is a 2 stage system.

#Stage 1 - 70% by "Per Head" allocation
The total allocation of NP money will be split 70/30. Stage 1 deals with the 70%.  
This 70% is to be divided between the CHEA houses on a per resident member ("per head") basis, with each resident member receiving the same amount of maintenance allocation assigned to them, regardless of what CHEA property they reside in.  Only resident members will be used in this calculation; associate members or residents who are not members will not be considered. 
The effect of this is to split the first 70% of the maintenance allocation equally based on resident population of the houses, with more populous houses receiving a larger amount.

#Stage 2 - 30% by "Planned Project" allocation
Stage 2 deals with the 30% remaining from the 70/30 split.
This 30% is to be divided between the CHEA houses for emergencies or according to projects agreed to each budget cycle by the CHEA Maintenance committee. The CHEA maintenance committee will consist of (potentially both house maintenance coordinators and the CHEA Treasure).  Projects will be proposed each year in the final quarter (4 months) of the  budget cycle if the 30% has not already been drained by emergency expenses.  Project proposals need clear descriptions and estimates of cost, risks, and duration.  By the budgeting decision deadline of the start of the next budget cycle, the Maintenance Committee will decide what projects they approve for that funding cycle.  
Any unallocated NP funds for a budget cycle can be split per the Stage 1 methodology, or saved for a later project, per the discretion of the Maintenance Committee, to allow for multi-year project planning.
