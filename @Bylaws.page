# Proposed amendments for the 9 August meeting

General Changes
---

I propose that in Article V we

1. Simply refer to the Chair as the Chair, not Chairperson; and
2. Remove the section detailing the responsibilities of the Member-at-Large, which may be shorter than this bullet point; and
3. Renumber the sections accordingly.

In Addition I propose rewriting selected sections as follows:

Section 1
---

> The elected officers of the Corporation shall be a Chair, a Secretary, a
> Treasurer, a Human Resources Officer, and a Community Representative.

Several Directors did not even know this office existed. The purpose of the Member-at-Large was, frankly, a title invented to give the fourth Director a title back when we first settled on having 2 Directors from each house and only 3 offices.

Section 2
---

> The Board shall elect directors to fill vacant offices in such a manner as is
> from time to time determined by the Board.

The current wording says that the "Membership" elects officers. Given that 

1. the purpose of officers is to divide the responsibilities of the board among the directors; and
2. there's no mention of anything like this in Article IV; and
3. no other board I've been on has people not on the board deciding who the directors are

I think a strong case can be made that the authors of the current wording meant "Membership" as in "Board Members."

Additionally I clarified that officers are to be directors, not just any person.

Section 4
---

> No person shall hold more than one of the offices designated in Section 1
> simultaneously, except in the event that the Board declares an emergency and
> appoints a director to temporarily fill a vacant office. In no event shall the
> offices of Chair and Secretary be held by the same person.

I have two goals with this edit: wording; and clarifying that an emergency appointment is temporary. I don't think this is a radical departure.
