title: How to add minutes
...

Adding minutes to the wiki may not be obvious at first, but it makes sense once you know what to do. There are basically two steps:

1. Upload the minutes document
2. Link to the minutes file from the [Minutes]() page.

# Uploading minutes document

The first step is uploading the minutes file on the [_upload]() page:

(Note that you'll need to put something in the "Description of content or changes" field. This wiki is very big on accountability.)

When the upload is finished you'll be presented with a short snippet of text. That text is a link that the wiki software can use to link to the minutes.

For example, if you uploaded a file for February 27, 2017 minutes called `02.27.17.docx` then the link will be `[02.27.17.docx](/02.27.17.docx)`. [^1]

Copy that link!

# Editing the Minutes page

With your link in hand, head over to the [Minutes]() page and select the `Edit` tab at the top. You should see this:

Paste the link in at the top and put something simple in the "Description of changes" field, like so

And that's it!

[^1]: You can actually change the first part between the `[` and `]` to say anything you want, like `[Minutes for 2 February, 2017](/02.27.17)`.
