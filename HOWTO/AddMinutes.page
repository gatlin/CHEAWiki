title: How to add minutes
...

Adding minutes to the wiki may not be obvious at first, but it makes sense once you know what to do. There are basically two steps:

1. Upload the minutes document
2. Link to the minutes file from the [Minutes]() page.

# Uploading minutes document

The first step is uploading the minutes file on the [_upload]() page:

![CHEA Wiki's file upload form](/chea_minutes_image_1.png)

(Note that you'll need to put something in the "Description of content or changes" field. This wiki is very big on accountability.)

When the upload is finished you'll be presented with a short snippet of text. That text is a link that the wiki software can use to link to the minutes.[^1]

For example, if you uploaded a file of the July 12, 2017 minutes called `07.12.17.pdf` then the link will be `[link label](/07.12.17.pdf)`.

Copy that link and move on to the next step! You're doing great!

# Edit the Minutes page

With your link in hand, head over to the [Minutes]() page and select the `edit` tab at the top. You should see this:

Paste the link in at the top and put something simple in the "Description of changes" field and edit the `link label`, like so

Note that you can put anything you want in place of `link label`. At the time of writing the format is `MM.DD.YY`.

# And that's it!

[^1]:
  Basically if you upload a file `filename.extension` it'll be available at `https://chea.coop/filename.extension`. The way you format links is `[text of the link](URL of the link)`. So `[07.12.17](/07.12.17.pdf)` isn't magical or anything, it's just literally a link to the minutes document.
