Welcome to the fledgling Wiki for the Community Housing Expansion of Austin. CHEA is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), cooperatively-owned housing organization in Austin, TX.

Our two houses are [Sasona][sasona] and [La Reunion][lareunion]. Our goal is to provide affordable, equitable housing in the Austin area and to promote cooperation near and far.
