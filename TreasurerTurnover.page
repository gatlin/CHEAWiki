title: Treasurer Turnover
...

There are a handful of tasks to be performed when transitioning from one Board Treasurer to another.

# Bank Accounts

The outgoing treasurer must be taken off all CHEA accounts, including house accounts. The incoming treasurer needs to be added to all relevant accounts. See the [Bylaws]() Section 8 for more information.

# Debit Cards

There are two main issues to consider regarding credit cards:

1. The new Treasurer must be issued a new debit card for the CHEA accounts; and
2. **Any services which are paid using the outgoing treasurer's debit cards** ***must*** **be transferred to the new debit card.**

## Services paid for with the treasurer's debit card

These are services paid for with the corporate debit card. **IT IS IMPORTANT TO SWITCH THESE OVER TO YOUR NEW CARD WHEN YOU TAKE OFFICE.** The old cards will be canceled and will not work any more.

### DigitalOcean

Without getting into the technical parts, one vital service we use for this very website is [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com). This is paid for using the Treasurer's debit card.

DigitalOcean credentials are included with other account and password information.
